# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
Oof. This was a toughie. I am proud of myself for managing my needs while getting through this assignment. As soon as I started to feel discouraged, I walked away and took a break. Then I came back and I was able to do what I couldn't before.
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
Functions allow us to reiterate a modification to our data with minimal effort. Once the function is created, you can use it with varying inputs and get different results, which makes it a tool that is reusable over time and has long-term staying power.
